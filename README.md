# Malware-detection-technique-using-ML

The scope of this project is to present a malware detection approach using machine learning. In this project we will focus on windows executable ﬁles. Because of the abnormal growth of these malicious software’s we need to use diﬀerent automated approaches to ﬁnd theses infected ﬁles.

In this project we are going to study and implement a script used for data extraction from the PE-ﬁles to create a data set with infected and clean ﬁles, on which we are gonna train our machine learning algorithms:K-nn, AdaBoost and Random Forest.
